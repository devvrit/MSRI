0. Get rid of additive approximation term and see if analysis can be improved.
1. Read about existing algorithms for regular correlation clustering and see if they can be extended to the case of general graphs.
2. Weighted analogue of the problem where vertices have removal cost.
3. Think about combinatorial algorithms for this problem.
4. General budgeted problem where vertices have a removal cost and edges have a misclassification penalty.
